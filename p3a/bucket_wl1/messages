align - Check that the forst pointer returned is 8-byte aligned
align2 - 8-byte alignment check for four allocations
alloc - One 16 byte allocation test
alloc2 - Four 16 byte allocations test
badfree - Freeing a pointer not returned by Mem_Alloc
badinit - Bad argument to Mem_Init
coalesce - Allocate all memory to 16 byte chunks, free 6 consecutive chunks and allocate an 80 byte chunk
doubleinit - Try to call Mem_Init twice
free - A 16 byte allocation followed by it's free
free2 - Two 16 byte allocations followed by two frees then followed by another two 16 byte allocations followed by their frees
free3 - A lot of interspersed 16 byte allocations and frees
init - Test Mem_Init by a size of 4096
init2 - Mem_Init with 1, expecting rounding to page table size which is 4096, trying to fit at least 250 16 byte allocations into it
nospace - Mem_Init with 4096, trying to allocate as many 16 byte chunks as possible while counting them. Count should be more than 248 and strictly less than 256
nullfree - Trying to free a NULL pointer
writeable - Writes a single integer to the pointer returned after a 16 byte allocation
writeable2 - Allocate 4 16 byte chunks fill them with a, b, c and d respectively and compare if anything got overlapped
